# The Richard-based Model and Two-Phase Flow Model

This repository contains two MATLAB-based models (2D) for simulating unsaturated flow in porous media:  
1. **Richard (RE) Model**: A model for simulating single-phase flow.  
2. **Two-Phase Flow (TP) Model**: A model for simulating two-phase flow.

## Installation and Usage
To use these models, simply download the repository into your MATLAB directory.

## Getting Start
Confer to the cases. The parameter inputs for each model are defined in the 'Inputdata.m' file. The results for each case can be generated by running the 'run_main.m' script. The example cases included in the documentation are primarily intended for model verification and comparison between the two models.
