# The Richard-based (RE) Model and Two-Phase Flow (TP) Model

This repository contains two MATLAB-based models for simulating unsaturated flow in porous media:  
1. **Richard (RE) Model**: A model for simulating single-phase flow.  
2. **Two-Phase Flow (TP) Model**: A model for simulating two-phase flow.





## Installation

To use these models, simply download the repository into your MATLAB directory. There are no additional installation steps required.
